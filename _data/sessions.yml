  subtitle: #"Room: 407.208"
  description: "<p>Privacy, security, and ethics are fundamental considerations when using data in research and practice. Indeed, ever more data enables dramatic leaps in our ability to extract a person from signals at the expense of privacy: people’s ability to control their own conception and its expression. This dilemma is further fuelled by ever growing concerns on cyber security, and the variance in moral principles that govern the generation, access, use, and sharing of data. This workshop explains and organises key concepts for responsible data management and provides a range of recommendations and resources that help you navigate challenging data territory.</p>

In this small workshop we'll show you how to analyse a small genomics dataset from start to finish on the command line. We'll touch on the various small tools experienced bioinformaticians employ, hopefully giving you a starting point for your learning journey.
This workshop will not be interactive, but we welcome chances for digressions. We don't expect any prerequisite knowledge.</p>

  <p>The answers to these questions are project-dependent, and each project is different… but there are guidelines and best practices to help you decide.</p>
  
  <p>During this interactive session, we will seek to answer these and associated questions. We'll hear real stories from individuals who have had to navigate these same questions and who will be on hand to facilitate discussion, based on years of experience working with early, mid and late career researchers.</p>
