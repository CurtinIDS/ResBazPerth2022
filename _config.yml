# About Block
aboutTitle: "About ResBaz Perth 2022"
aboutSubtitle: "Community, Conference and Campaign"
aboutText: "<p>The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research.</p>

<p>Hosted in-person at Curtin University in 2022 by the WA Data Science Innovation Hub, the Perth Research Bazaar is <b>a low-cost 3-day</b> conference where researchers come together to up-skill in 'next generation digital research tools and skills'. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!</p>
<p>Perth ResBaz 2022 is a combination of computational training workshops (such as introduction to version control, introduction to R, introduction to python), electives (shorter 45 to 90 minute tutorials), and community events. Networking and social sessions form an important component of ResBaz, bringing together all participants to meet and network and to hear from keynote speakers and panelists.</p>
<p>Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to attend. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along! Sessions at ResBaz this year are intended to offer a brief practical introduction to a broad selection of topics and tools related to digital research practice relevant across the disciplines.</p>

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}

He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn‚Äôt use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
